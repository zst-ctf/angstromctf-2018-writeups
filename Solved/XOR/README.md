# XOR
crypto - 40 points

## Challenge 
We found these [mysterious symbols](ciphertext.txt) hidden in ancient (1950s-era) ruins. We think a single byte may be key to unlocking the mystery. Can you help us figure out what they mean?

## Hint
I cancel myself out, create from nothing, and negate from everything. What am I?


## Solution

Single key is simple. Bruteforce using my script (`solve.py `)
