## Challenge 
One common method of public key encryption is the [RSA algorithm]. Given [p, q, e, and c](intro_rsa.txt), see if you can recover the message and find the flag!

[RSA algorithm]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)

## Hint
This one is straightforward, any programming language should be able to do this just fine.

## Solution

Similar to: https://github.com/ctfs/write-ups-2013/tree/master/pico-ctf-2013/rsa

Using my script, `solve.py`
