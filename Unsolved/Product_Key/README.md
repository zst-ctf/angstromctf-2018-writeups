# Product Key
re - 200 points

## Challenge 
Artemis wants a copy of Windows, but she doesn't feel like paying for it. She decided to hack Microsoft's servers to generate a product key, and found their [verification software](activate), which runs on Linux for some reason. Can you get her a working product key (form `ABCD-EFGH-IIJK-LMNO-PQRS-TUVW`, each uppercase letter is a digit) using the email `artemis.tosini@example.com`?
